# 'DECISION MAKERS' - Year 3 Final-Project
The European Parliament has a key role in the legislative process of the
European Union. It discusses, negotiates and votes on draft legislation put
forward by the European Commission and, as co-legislator with the Council,
passes European laws. The parliament is composed of 751 members (MEPs)
who represent the 28 member states of the European Union.

I have been interested in European politics for a long time. I admire the work
of the European Union, but I am also curious to know more about the
law-making process. With my skill set, what better way to find out than to
analyse the data?

I have chosen to analyse the vote on Directive (EU) 2019/790 on Copyright in
the Digital Single Market, approved by the parliament on the 17th April 2019.
This vote is interesting to me because of its connection with technology and
the fact that the topic proved extremely divisive. The proposal was widely
perceived as opposing traditional and new media and was extensively debated
in the press, online and in the European Parliament itself.

Specifically, this Directive reinforces the rights of media groups and content
creators over their product in the digital environment. It was argued however
that the measure could increase cost for news aggregators, video streaming
services and social media platforms. Tech companies and human rights
advocates in particular expressed concern that imposing copyright protection
on user-generated content on Internet platforms would necessitate upload
filters and could limit freedom of speech. It can be seen therefore that the
proposal generated clearly defined positions for and against.

This project focuses on the networks of connections surrounding the European
decision-makers (the MEPs). Social connections affect and shape the
relationship between policy makers and society. I propose to categorise the
MEPs by party, age, gender and geographical location, test for significant
correlations between the categories and their votes, and make global
hypotheses as to the reasons for these correlations - or absence of correlations,
when analysing by category. I will then conduct analysis on these exceptions,
using techniques such as Graph Mining and Social Network Analysis to
investigate the political influences that affected their decision. The majority of
the data I will use for this project will be retrieved from public sources
including social media and press events.
