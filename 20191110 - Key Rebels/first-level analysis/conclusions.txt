Age - Age is a major factor in how an MEP could vote. We can assume that a majority of older MEPs value traditional media over new-age media. 
	This trend seems to reverse when looking at MEPs younger than the average.
	Considering the directive favours traditional media, why did some of the older MEPs vote against the directive?

Gender - gender does not seem to be a significant factor in how an MEP votes.

Political Group - Is a major factor in how an MEP voted. More radical parties favour new media whereas less radical parties seem to favour traditional media, in particular the right (EPP).

Location - Seems to be significant (polarising). The Eu13 (new members, mostly eastern-european countries), traditionally in favour of technology, voted more towards new media.
	The eu15 (older members, more western countries), voted in favour of traditional media.
